The Cocktail Cabinet is a simple, easy-to-use, user friendly 
go to cocktail app for cocktail enthusiasts.

This project was created for the UofT bootcamp as the first
collaborative project done as a class in groups.

## Tech & Features

- The Cocktail DB
For our first and main API, we used The Cocktail DB. A big database with many
different drinks to choose from all with their own recipe, directions, ingredients and video.

- Google Maps
Whats the use looking at drinks when you can go get one! Is what we thought when 
using Google Maps for our second API. With Google Maps we were able to show the 
user bars around their location to go and get a drink at.

- Tailwind
For our CSS Framework we decided to use Tailwind, it's simple and easy-to-use while
also being loose and versitile.  
---
- Saving Drinks
 To make use of localstorage in our project we allowed users to save their
 favorite drinks, letting them look back at their most frequently made drinks.

## Development Process

Being a smaller concept and having a team of 5, tasks were hard to hand out.
So our development approach was collaborative opting to all work together to achieve
the implementation of features for a single application rather than creating a website.

This approach to development worked very well, updates were put out frequently,
merge conflics were rare and productivity was much higher when being able to 
work together on features rather than assigning features.

 This targeted input to features held many benefits including. The code quality and 
 feature results were more polished.
